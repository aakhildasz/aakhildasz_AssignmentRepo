# Solidity Contracts

This repository contains a collection of basic Solidity contracts that demonstrate various concepts and functionalities.

## Contracts

1. **Hello World Contract**: A simple contract that returns a "Hello, World!" message.
2. **Simple Storage**: A contract that allows storing and retrieving a single integer value.
3. **Greeting Contract**: A contract that allows users to set and get a personalized greeting message.
4. **Simple Counter**: A contract that tracks a count and allows it to be incremented.
5. **Name Storage**: A contract that allows storing and retrieving a user's name.
6. **Basic Voting**: A contract that allows users to vote for candidates and keeps track of votes.
7. **Owner Access**: A contract that restricts certain functions to only the contract owner.
8. **Event Logging**: A contract that logs events when specific actions are performed.
9. **Simple Ledger**: A contract that maintains a simple ledger of transactions.

## Usage

To use these contracts, you can deploy them on a blockchain network such as Ethereum using a tool like Truffle or Remix.

## Prerequisites

* Solidity compiler (solc) version 0.8.0 or higher
* Truffle or Remix for deployment
